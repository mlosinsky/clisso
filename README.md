Features that need to be implemented before v1:

- [ ] write tests for ssoclient and e2e_tests
- [ ] e2e_test with keycloak and vault
- [ ] e2e_test with different IdP (not keycloak)
- [x] CI - test ssoproxy(+coverage), ssoclient(+coverage), e2e_tests
- [ ] refactor and write doc strings
- [ ] README.md - info, install, how to use, show coverage
- [ ] refactor CLI example and proxy example
- [ ] cleanup/remove local/ directory
